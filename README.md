# cli-Stock-Market-Analysis
This is a cli tool for checking different stock market prices and plotting the data (candlestick plotting is also available).

This is a simple python code that uses pandas datareader to get stock market prices and plot them out using matplotlib for the linear plots and mlpfinance for the candlestick plots.

If you have a StockSymbol API you can get a list of the different markets and stock symbols from within the program. If not you will need to know the specific stock symbol that you want to find.
